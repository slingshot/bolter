# Slingshot Send

> Open source, end-to-end encrypted file sharing

Slingshot Send is an open source, secure file sharing application that enables users to share files with true end-to-end encryption. Files are encrypted client-side before upload, and encryption keys are never sent to the server.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Files are encrypted in your browser using AES-GCM before upload
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Encryption keys are embedded in shareable URLs (hash fragment) and never transmitted to the server
- **Large File Support**: Upload files up to 1TB via multipart uploads
- **Expiring Links**: Set time-based expiration (1 hour to 30 days) and download limits
- **No Account Required**: Share files instantly without registration
- **Direct Downloads**: Files are downloaded directly from cloud storage for speed

## How It Works

1. Select a file to upload
2. The file is encrypted in your browser using AES-GCM with a randomly generated key
3. The encrypted file is uploaded directly to cloud storage
4. You receive a shareable link containing the decryption key in the URL hash
5. Recipients download and decrypt the file entirely in their browser

## Privacy

- Encryption keys never leave your browser (stored in URL hash fragment)
- Server only sees encrypted data
- Metadata is stored with TTL and automatically deleted
- No tracking, no accounts, no logs of file contents

## Technical Details

- Encryption: AES-256-GCM with HKDF key derivation
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend: Elysia (Bun) + Redis + S3-compatible storage
- All cryptographic operations use the Web Crypto API
